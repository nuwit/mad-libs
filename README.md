# Mad Libs Coding Night! ðŸ˜œ 

Welcome to Mad Libs Coding Night! Here are the steps to code your own mini Mad Libs app! If you get confused, feel free to ask questions. 

### 1. Download a code editor
A code editor will make it easier for you to look at and edit the code for your mad libs app. 

Here are some great **open source** code editor that is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux:
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**: Microsoft's code editor with a super sleek user interface and terminal integration.  
- **[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)**
- **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**
There are lots of other code editors out there if you'd prefer something different, but Visual Studio Code is the code editor we'll be using during our demos. 

Got it all downloaded? Great!

## 2. Download the starter code

Navigate to this repository again: (here)[bit.ly/mad-libs-nuwit]

Press this button and select **Download ZIP**

Make sure you save the folder somewhere you can remember! Then, use your file explorer to navigate to the saved zip. Unzip the folder. Feel free to delete the zip and keep the unzipped files. 

## 3. Open the folder in a code editor.

For atom or sublime this might look a little different, but use this option to open the `mad-libs` folder wherever you saved it:
